# okay-lean — notes for agents

- Lean 4, `v4.35.0` pinned in `lean-toolchain`; no dependencies. `lake build` builds the library and checks the
  proofs; `lake test` runs `Tests/Main.lean` (the `test` executable, lake's test driver). Both must pass before a
  commit; no `sorry` — Lean only warns about it, so grep the build output.
- The specification is okay-simple (`~/work/my/okay-simple`, `core/free/.../Free.scala`, `Places.scala`, `Std.scala`):
  a program is data (`Free.ret`, `Free.impure op k`), the row a `List Effect` with the handled-next effect FIRST
  (okay-simple's `R + E` has it last), places typed (`Place`, `Split` with `Rest` an `outParam`, `In`), handlers
  `handle` / `answer` / `handleWith` / `handleAt`. Port the next pieces the same way: `Delimited` (shift and
  reset), `Sub`/`embed`, `Yield`, `Fresh`, `Random`, `Store` are not here yet.
- Lean's universes: `Free R A : Type 1` (the existential `X` in `impure`), so `At`, `Place` are `Type 1` too; effects
  are `Type → Type`. An effect carrying a program as an answer would need a universe bump — not done.
- Notation `A ! R` is `Free R A`; application binds tighter, so write `(List A) ! R`. A handler of a parameterized
  effect whose parameter the value does not fix takes it explicitly: `writer String`, `attempt String`; a word whose
  parameter the row does not fix needs an ascription: `let name : String ← ask`.
- Laws: every handler of a standard effect gets its equations in `Std.lean`'s `Laws` section, `rfl` where it
  computes, induction where it does not (`all_among`). `Free R` is a `LawfulMonad` (`Laws.lean`).
- Commits: no Co-Authored-By lines.
